NBC plans for asphalt subcontractor to complete patches once our interior parking lots are paved. Landscaping is currently underway and interior paving will commence once planting is completed. Asphalt subcontractor is estimating 1 week to complete repair of patches in Platt Road.

Question:    The permit lists the applicant as Corby, which I get because you guys applied for the ROW permit (when our system was done) but the attachment is from Metro and indicates they are the applicant.  Can you please confirm who the correct applicant should be and who will be paying the invoice? 

Once you respond I can fix or issue. 
Thanks

For City projects, funds should be transferred for TCP and ROW뭩.  We have no authority to waive established fees.  Transferring in effect charges the fee to the specific project and sends the revenue to the ROW fund (0049).  If you let me now the costs, I will ensure the transfer occurs with the appropriate accoutns.

Marti,

I want to make sure we are doing this the correct way. Initially, Christina wanted funds transferred for this project so I started working on that with Kathryn. Then Anne wanted it issued with no fees because it뭩 a city project. So I wanted to confirm with her and now she wants funds transferred.

Are all ROWs and TCPs for city projects supposed to be issued with no fees? Or should funds be transferred in this case?","0","405","405","TETRA TECH MPS, INC.","-83.70641","42.22687"

Per contractor: I apologize but I뭢 a little confused as to the reason for these revision requests. We had the entire route already approved by the City under permit ROW20-0658. The only thing that changed and the reason for us re-sending it is because we had a pole denial we had to re-route underground which is on sheet UG 2.

The sanitary main is in the road.  Please confirm that you do not intend to go into the street to do any work (which is what I suspect), however, we need you as the contractor to acknowledge that the property owner knows they are responsible for the lead all the way to the main, not just the right-of-way.  

Please respond so we can have the Engineer finish with the review of your ROW permit. 

Thank you.

Tammy, this appears to be a duplicate of ROW20-0896.  Can you reach out to the applicant to confirm if ROW20-1175 is still needed?  It looks like they uploaded a drawing on September 12th, but no reviews were entered, so they probably didn뭪 notify CS.

Note from Engineer  please see below.  Make necessary adjustments in TRAKIT, let me know and I will have the Engineer review with correct info. 


Subject: ROW20-1189

This permit is attached to 206 Glen Ave, but the attachments are for E. Huron River Drive.  Can you ask them which is correct?  If E. Huron River Drive is correct, I뭭e noted that the work appears to be taking place in the road, not the dirt, as indicated on the Face Sheet.

For City projects, funds should be transferred for TCP and ROW뭩.  We have no authority to waive established fees.  Transferring in effect charges the fee to the specific project and sends the revenue to the ROW fund (0049).  If you let me now the costs, I will ensure the transfer occurs with the appropriate accoutns.

Marti,

I want to make sure we are doing this the correct way. Initially, Christina wanted funds transferred for this project so I started working on that with Kathryn. Then Anne wanted it issued with no fees because it뭩 a city project. So I wanted to confirm with her and now she wants funds transferred.

Are all ROWs and TCPs for city projects supposed to be issued with no fees? Or should funds be transferred in this case?

Good Afternoon  

A contractor (Midwestern) came in and paid for water & sewer kills for the above referenced address.    This kill needs to be a PERMANENT kill for both water & sewer.  The kills need to be killed at the main, not temps to the property line.  If you have, any questions please contact aheatley@a2gov.org

Note from Engineer reviewing permit:   Please email customerservice@a2gov.org when you have uploaded drawing.  

ROW20-1245      Need clarification.  One document notes work to take place in the BC (Back of Curb, implying no pavement cutting), and the Face Sheet document notes work will be in asphalt.  Please revise the incorrect document and upload.  Inform Customer Service when upload is complete so they can route for review

(10/29/2020 7:46 AM MB)
Did you load the correct drawing  into eTrakit?  What you provided us is the same attachment that was already loaded.     Please upload a new drawing per notes below and email customerservice@a2gov.org they are the ones who will route this to Engineering.  Just sending these to me will delay the process.

Per Ah - ROW20-1261      Description is 밅ity of Ann Arbor Street Light Service.  Can you ask them if the wood pole shown on the drawing is for a streetlight or for other electrical components, or both?  Also, ask if this is proposed to be bored or will be open cut the full length.  Boring locations need to be shown on the drawing.

DTE is not installing any conduits or digging any trenches.   The contractor that is representing the City of Ann Arbor is the one who installed conduit from pole to meter location.

ROW20-1264      Please pass on the following notes.  The depth of the sanitary sewer at the manhole in Washtenaw is 9 deep.  Refer to as-built information to determine the depth of the sanitary main in Wilmot Street at this proposed crossing location.  Additionally, the profile incorrectly references E Dobson Street.

Tammy,

Sorry for the delay on getting this back in. We uploaded the revised set to etrakit. We did confirm based on the drawings sent to us that the sanitary we are cross is shown at the correct depth.

ROW20-1263      Please pass on the following comments:  Provide profiles for all utility crossings. Clarify if the pedestal shown at the south end of the work is existing or proposed.
Also, Tiffany, added you as a reviewer.  They show this tree on the drawing, but I don뭪 see it on GIS.

Good morning Tammy,
The pedestal is existing at the south end of the property. 
I think there is a tree there, its not as big as the drawing seems to be. I am looking in Google maps and I see one.

Hello Alison,

We are just temporarily removing these overhead lines, but not the poles, to facilitate the installation of a modular house.   Once the house is set, we will return, and re-install the overhead lines and remove the temporarily installed lines on Cherry.  That work was submitted under permit #ROW20-1267.   The purpose of this work is to avoid customer outages created by removing this span of overhead wires.

Thank you,

The street patch shall match the existing cross section with a minimum cross section as follows:

	Asphalt Pavement - Match existing thickness (3 inches minimum of LVSP or 13A HMA mix)
	Base - 8 inches of Class 21 AA Dense-Graded Aggregate
	Subbase  6 inches of Class II Granular Material (typically this will be thicker since this material will also be used as backfill above the connection)

Please see engineering comments from Engineer who is reviewing permit: 

 This makes no sense because the sidewalk program would generally replace sidewalk.  Where these 2 slabs (which would usually be 50 SF) of sidewalk are located?  If they are on private property, they do not need a ROW permit.  The Google Map just shows the whole frontage with no indication of where the slab or slabs are to replace. 

Please let me know your response so I can continue having this reviewed if this is a valid permit.

This work was already done without a valid permit???  
Please return this ASAP to me or fax 734-994-8991

Comments issued from engineer who reviewed your ROW permit: 
The attached shows two different addresses.  408 Potter Street is written on the permit application, but 1109 Belmar is the Google Map and where the permit as attached.  They need clarify where the work is taking place, and revise either the application or the drawing.
Please make corrections, upload new info into eTrakit and once done, please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we know to have this ROW permit reviewed.

Notes from applicant: 
The Approach to 408 Potter Ave, Ann Arbor is located on Belmar st. So when using google maps it shows the wrong address to view the Approach for 408 potter ave.
The work is going to be done at 408 Potter ave, Ann Arbor and the picture is of the approach at 408 Potter Ave.

(11/3/2020 2:19 PM KK1)
The correct address for the parcel is 1109 Belmar Place.  I have corrected the address on the permit.  This permit is now approved.  Please contact Mark at 765-748-1063 to arrange for payment of the permit.

Mark, I see what happened  when you responded about the Belmar permit, you referenced the wrong permit number (one for W Washington Street), so the information did not make its way to the correct permit.  I made the made the modifications to the proper permit for the Belmar Drive approach (ROW20-1291).

Per Alison, cancel ROW20-1297, have them submit a new application and open a new permit number.  Let me know if you have to issue a refund or can apply the funds to the new permit.  There will be additional charges because they added length, I will have review time.  You can let them know that they are not showing all the utilities in Summit, they are missing at least two transmission water mains and the sanitary sewer.

Clarify what 밢HG refers to (i.e., specify it on the drawing).
Note the length of the fiber to be installed. 

Additionally, who is the proposed pole owner?  The applicant does not have authority to install a pole in the public right-of-way.

(10/6/2020 4:52 PM TK)
Good afternoon, 

The updated plans have been uploaded. DG- down guy, OHG overhead guy. There is no new fiber placement. DTE placed a new pole and Windstream needs to remove the anchor/DG from the old pole and place on the new pole. This is approx. 92 of Strand. Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you!

Hello  I have attached a drawing to the permit.  

I thought that I had attached a drawing as well as a highlighted photo with the initial permit request.  Please let me know if this did not go through so I can correct the mistake the next time I apply for a permit.

Thank you,

80 sf of sidewalk is noted for replacement, which is about 3 flags of sidewalk.  Clarify if this permit is only for Observatory, or all locations shown on the plan.

This permit is only for the location at Observatory.  Other locations had been completed previously.

In addition, we are unable to issue your permit until you submit your liability insurance.    Please email a copy to myself and customerservice@a2gov.org so we can enter your policy in our system.  Failure to do so will result in no permit.

Please ask the applicant if ROW20-1391is a duplicate permit of already issued permit ROW20-0521 for 908 S Forest Ave.  Or if this is a new permit, what are the changes.

The correct permit should be ROW20-1391. The Verizon permit number is ROW19-1831.

We had an issue with a similar permit and Alison Heatly said that the permits should be in the name of the contractor performing the work.

Kenilworth was treated with a cape seal and is under moratorium.  The contractor will be required to only patch the open cut area in the street that is necessary to make the connection, and DTE must seal the perimeter of the patch.  The composition of the cross section required for the patch shall be a minimum:

	Asphalt Pavement - Match existing thickness (3 inches minimum of LVSP or 13A HMA mix)
	Base - 8 inches of Class 21 AA Dense-Graded Aggregate
	Subbase  6 inches of Class II Granular Material (typically this will be thicker since this material will also be used as backfill above the connection)

Note from our Engineer who reviewed your permit application:  
Please ask Haley to confirm that the homeowner is aware they are responsible for the entire sewer lead to the sewer main, not just to the curb.  The drawing notes 밡o Sidewalk, but there is sidewalk fronting this parcel.  This needs to be clarified.  If they stop the work before the sidewalk and on the private property, a ROW permit would not be needed.  
Please confirm and fix on your plans, re-load a new set of plans and email customerservice@a2gov.org when done so we can have engineering team continue to review your application.","8175","0","0","Haley Mechanical","-83.726","42.26057"

Note from Engineering  

Please ask them to clarify where the lead is going.  There is a tree in front of the house, and the provided picture does not provide enough detail.

Please clarify and provide more detail so we can continue on having this permit reviewed.

(10/26/2020 8:30 AM MB)
The new pipe is approximately 15 ft south of the street tree and south of the recent water line replacement already performed (excavated) by others in the lawn extension.  

Thanks

Your permit is on hold for no drawing.  Please load a drawing into eTrakit and once done, please email cusotmerservice@a2gov.org so we can review your permit application.

Note from Engineer reviewing permit:  Need to know method of construction.  They say sidewalk won뭪 be affected, so are they boring, pipe bursting?
Please note that on drawing, re-load a drawing and email customerservice@a2gov.org so we can have this permit be finished be reviewing.

Michelle, 

I had put 뱒ewer replacement from house to manhole via pipe bursting in the long description for the ROW application on etrakit. I didn뭪 realize that you wanted that information on the picture as well. Please see attached with requested wording.

Thank you!

Please note that TRAKiT Custom Screens says this:
 

This is contrary to what is presented on the drawing, which says pipe bursting to manhole.  So before issuing, can someone please confirm with the applicant  are they disturbing the street (i.e., street cut), or not?  Fees noted on the permit are for NO pavement cutting. 

Thanks!

HI Tammy,

We are not disturbing the street. This is the second time that etrakit has shown 뱘es along with a square footage when I did not select that. We are not cutting the street and will be pipe bursting from house to mahole.

Thanks,

Thanks.  Can you make that correction in the Custom Screens?  The fees should be good for no pavement cutting.

Please read below and confirm what the reviewing Engineer is requesting. 



The contractor is required to patch the open cut area in the street that is minimally necessary to make the connection.  The City will seal the perimeter of it as part the Street Preventative Maintenance contract work. The minimum composition of the cross section required for the patch on this local street is shown below

	Asphalt Pavement - Match existing thickness (3 inches minimum of LVSP or 13A HMA mix)
	Base - 8 inches of Class 21 AA Dense-Graded Aggregate
	Subbase  6 inches of Class II Granular Material (typically this will be thicker since this material will also be used as backfill above the connection)


If Mr. Knight says he is not cutting the pavement, I would like him to acknowledge that he has informed the homeowner that they are responsible for the remainder of the lead to the sewer main, and that if the portion of the lead under the road is Orangeburg, failure is likely.","0","440","440","Knight Robert","-83.70114","42.26046"

I was asked to follow up and see if this ROW permit should be cancelled?

(2/16/2021 8:22 AM MB)
Hi Michelle,

I presume you mean 20-1455?

I had recently asked that the hold be removed for 20-0068 which proposes doing a directional bore along the same path on E. University that is also proposed under 20-1455.  

If your inquiry is what this is referring to , then yes, if 20-0068 gets approved, we would modify 20-1455 to show the bore connecting to the conduit down E. University that is proposed to be placed 20-0068.  If this is the case, we뭠l cancel 20-1455 and resubmit a new app and plans taking into consideration the route under 20-0068.

Thanks,

Note from Engineer reviewing your permit below: 

This description (PERFORM SIDEWALK  RESTORATION AT 1763 PLYMOUTH RD) is curious.  We need more information.  Are they only removing and replacing sidewalk because it뭩 bad sidewalk?  Or are they doing other work that is requiring them to 뱑estore the sidewalk?  Also, the attachment in TRAKiT doesn뭪 tell me where they are doing work, it looks more like a ped detour plan.  


Please respond to me in details and I will have our Engineering Department continue reviewing your permit.","4000","17.16","17.16","SITE MAINTENANCE GROUP LLC","-83.72029","42.29846"

Customer sent in adjustment to Sidewalk fee and Brian approved the change. 

293 x 5 = 1465 x 63 days = 92,295 x .05 = $4614.75

Will update and send new invoice.

customer wants to extend permit until 4/30/21
will figure out costs.
i emailed brian nollar for approval

(1/11/2021 3:29 PM TK)
processing fee 20.00
barricade inspection fee  806.00(89 days divided by 7 = 13 weeks)
street fee  2160 x 89 days = 192240 x .015 = 2883.60
sidewalk fee 1465 x 89 days = 130385 x .05 = 6519.25

(1/13/2021 9:15 AM TK)
Yes it is fine to extend, I was just told they are going to do this every 3 months for the next 2 years. Not sure why? Maybe they don뭪 have the money to put the whole amount for the 2 years but I will inquire so we don뭪 have to keep this up every 3 months.

Question on permit application - 15 SF of sidewalk doesn뭪 make sense (generally).  Can you confirm that it is 15 SF and not linear feet?  If it뭩 15 LF, that would be 75 SF of sidewalk  might not even make a difference with the sidewalk fees.  
Once you let me know, I can send over payment info and get permit issued.

(11/25/2020 8:32 AM MB)
Hi Michelle  we are actually just adjusting the sidewalk, not removing and replacing, but there was not an option for that.  We are going to raise the slab of one of the pieces of sidewalk to match the others.  So I guess we could put whatever the size of one slab of sidewalk is, 30 SF?

Let me know if I need to change anything on the permit request.

Thank you,

We will need a drawing / showing where you intend to work.  (greenbelt) before we can review/issue permit.   Please submit me pic of ROW in PDF form and I will load to permit and have reviewed.

(12/2/2020 2:04 PM MB)
Please return this payment info so we can issue your permit.  If you would like we have a new secure payment portal (Chase Bank) that can store your info in our system so going forward if you have an approved permit, we simply would send you invoice and you say please pay and would avoid payment coversheets.  

If you would like to save the info when you pay for this permit, please let me know.  Otherwise, we destroy cc info.

Comments from Engineer reviewing permit:  

	What is the difference between the black line noted as proposed and the red line?  
	Is the red line a replacement sewer lead for the black line?  If yes, then the plan must also show notes indicating the existing lead in black will be properly abandoned.

Service leads must connect to the main perpendicularly, not on an angle as shown.  All changes in direction must occur on private property, not in the public right-of-way.
Normally, manholes cannot be tapped, but since this is a terminal manhole, up to three taps will be allowed.  

Please respond to these questions to customerservice@a2gov.org and myself so we can get your response to Engineer.

(1/7/2021 8:42 AM MB)
My understanding is that you gave Alison a new set of drawings and she wants to confirm what you sent her is what you plan to do?  Once I hear back I can either approve or deny your permit.

Your ROW permit application is on hold.  Please log into eTrakit and upload a drawing of the work, row and pavement disturbance so we can have an Engineer review permit.

(12/7/2020 12:21 PM MB)
Please be advised we have requested you to load a set of drawing into eTrakit for your pending ROW permit.    Once done you need to email customerservice@a2gov.org and myself so we know to have an Engineer review your ROW permit. 
Failure to work without an approved ROW permit can result in a ticket being issued.

per AH: Send them the fee for greenbelt disturbance.  If they only did a repair and it was all on private property, there won뭪 be a fee due, but we뭠l let them tell us that.

(12/11/2020 10:16 AM MB)
Please be advised based on the photo this is your current ROW permit fee.  If there is pavement disturbance there will be an additional fee.

I have received authorization to share our videos, however they will come from DTE, not our contractor Hydromax. 

Once work is complete we can arrange a way to transport the files. They are typically on a hard drive or SD drive.

Hello 
Is this ROW permit application for Community Lighting?  If so going forward these need to be identified as Community Lighting correctly, so we can expedite and invoice appropriately.   
Please confirm so we can continue reviewing permit application and change applicant on application. 
Thanks

Good Afternoon,
In August we had completed a fiber project on behalf of City of Ann Arbor at the Ann Ashley Parking Garage. The conduit was recently damaged by another underground contractor and we were dispatched to repair the conduit as an emergency. The repaired cable needs to be replaced with a new permanent cable. I have attached the as built plans to show where the cable needs to be replaced along with the original permits on the job. As mention, this is a cable replacement, can you please tell me  how we should proceed with this?

Thank you, 

Erica Bennett

Per Alison Heatley
Please have them submit a new permit with the attachments provided and a copy of the email.  The email should also include what means of replacement are required (e.g., excavation or just pulling fiber through existing conduit).

In order for us to approve/issue your ROW permit we need you to provide the length of fiber being pulled. 

Please let me know so I can get permit approved. 
Thanks 
Michelle Brainard

Good evening, 

The length of fiber to be pulled is 400.

Comment from Engineer reviewing your ROW permit application: 
Row20-1573       The permit subtype is noted as 밨epair, but in the description noted 뱑enew existing gas service, which implies entire replacement.  Please confirm.  A profile of the gas lead showing City utilities must be provided for the lead if it is a replacement.  There is a 12 water main in Packard St not shown on the drawing.  Additionally, label PLD on the plans. 

Please make corrections and note if this is a repair or renew existing gas service.  Once new plans are loaded into eTrakit email customerservice@a2gov.org and myself so we can have our Engineer finish reviewing your permit application.

Good afternoon Michelle,

ROW21-0124

I was unable to modify the application to reflect that it was not a main repair.  But it is also not a main install, so I created the new application and used the subtype SERVICE LEAD.  Cobblestone Farms increased their gas usage and requires that the gas service lead to their property to be improved.  Jason Nealis of Ann Arbor is the project contact and he is cc뭗 in this email.

I have made the requested revisions:

	The permit is no longer submitted as a gas main repair
	The drawing includes a profile of the proposed gas crossing the other utilities (although the records received from Ann Arbor do not include any elevation data where we cross existing facilities  see attached).
	The drawing shows and labels the 12 water main.
	The drawing shows and labels the PLD conduits.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thank you,

David Walsh

ROW permit is on hold for the following comments: 

This application was noted as Non-Metro Act, though the plans note it is for fiber.  Verizon (noted on the Cover Sheet) does not have permission to place non-Metro Act related items in the public right-of-way.  The relationship between Gabes Construction and Verizon is unclear.  If this IS METRO Act related, Gabes must provide a letter of authorization from Verizon that Gabes is pulling permits for Verizon under its METRO Act Permit.

Alison Heatley, Private Development Coordinator

Notes per Engineer reviewing permit: 

This is an antenna on a DTE pole.  Project Summary on cover sheet describes a wood pole, but it뭩 a steel streetlight pole.  A stop sign is mounted to it.  The antenna drawing does not show the streetlight on it, just the pole and antenna.  This one is lacking the phrasing on the cover sheet of 밡o trenching, boring or significant excavations are included in this scope of work.  Notes pertaining to underground construction are included for reference only.  This phrase is included on 1583.

Please make changes, load new drawing into eTrakit and when done please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we can have engineer finish review.

Note from engineer doing review of your ROW permit: 

The last page of their submittal is not legible?  Also, I am waiting for Forestry to give approval of the tap as there is a City tree located very close to where they propose to excavate.

Please load a new set of readable plans and upload into eTrakit.  Once you do, please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we know to have row application reviewed again.

This, permit is conditionally approved.  The condition is 밒f the hole stays 4x3 or smaller they should be ok.  Effort should be made to stay away from trunk as far as possible. 

Please confirm you understand the stipulations for permit.

Your ROW permit is on hold for the following comments issued by Engineering: 

Verizon does not have authority to install power lines within public rights-of-way, which is what is noted in the Description of Work.  Plan cover sheet indicates work is for small cell.  Meaning of file description "FCD" is not clear.

Once you have corrected the problem, load info into eTrakit and email customerservice@a2gov.org once that has been done to have them continue reviewing permit.","2500","0","0","CLEARLINK WIRELESS SOLUTIONS, LLC","-83.74714","42.28064"

I emailed Shawn Burnside and Toya Troupe requesting he provide one to MES, though MES may have a different AT&T contact.  In addition, applicant shall provide a revised address that best reflects the location of this work.  

Once you fix and upload new revised and all info needed, please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we know to have this ROW permit rereviewed.","9500","0","0","","",""

Good Morning  your ROW permit ROW21-0028 has been cancelled in our system.  Unfortunately, our permitting system is location based which means we need a permit for each location.  (All 42 locations)  The PDF map showing all locations is fine to load into each permit that you apply for, but in order to process your ROW permits they need to go in via eTrakit for each address. 

Any questions please let me know. 

Thanks

Permit is on hold per comments from Engineering: 
For this permit, I뭢 not clear what the proposed work is.  On Page 5/Sheet D1, the only work that appears to be in the ROW is from the handhole 15 to the ROW, where presumably it goes on to private property (an address would be helpful or plan view over the profile since it뭩 not entire clear where this profile is).  Pages 3 and 4/Sheets 1 and 2 seem to show existing 123.net infrastructure that is not new to this permit application?  Or is it new?  On Sheet 2, it shows a utility crossing, but this crossing does not match the profile since it appears to be outside/north of the right-of-way.

Also, the applicant and contractor are listed as Olivia Graumann.  I know her name from 123.net, so I뭢 sure it뭩 their permit, but something needs to be corrected in TRAKiT since 123.net doesn뭪 show up anywhere!

Thanks.

Good afternoon Michelle,

I need to replace the plan page of permit #ROW21-0035 with the attached PDF.

The only change is the revised pdf, (dated today 210112), includes our client뭩 work order number. This is important to them for keeping track of their permits and work. The rest of the plan is unchanged.

I tried to see if I could do this through eTrakit, but it does not appear that I can.

Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,
Kris

Hello Nichole,

I tried to upload this revised file to eTRAKiT, but do not see how to do it. I see where I open the existing file, but not how to upload a new one.

I have moved the bore to the East/South side of Commonwealth as we discussed and have added a note indicating the length of bore within the ROW.

If you have any additional questions or comments, please let me know.

If you can let me know how to upload directly to eTRAKiT, I would be happy to do that as well.

Thank you.

Good Morning  

RE:  21-0036 

In order for us to review your ROW permit you will need to upload a map of the area you intend on working in.  Once you have done that, please email myself and customerservice@a2gov.org so we can have your permit reviewed. 

Thanks

Hi Kaitlyn and Tammy,

I뭢 hoping you can help me out.  There are two ROW permits (ROW21-038 and ROW21-039) that have the same address 2913 Ward Ct.  I accidentally duplicated efforts with Alicia.  
Is it possible to change one to 2911 Ward Ct?   This is the neighbor of 2913 that asked us to spot repair a 5 ft section of their line while we have the road dug up.  I have attached a drawing for reference.
Please let me know if you have any questions and if I can do anything to help.

Thank you!

Hi Kaitlyn and Tammy,

I뭢 hoping you can help me out.  There are two ROW permits (ROW21-038 and ROW21-039) that have the same address 2913 Ward Ct.  I accidentally duplicated efforts with Alicia.  
Is it possible to change one to 2911 Ward Ct?   This is the neighbor of 2913 that asked us to spot repair a 5 ft section of their line while we have the road dug up.  I have attached a drawing for reference.
Please let me know if you have any questions and if I can do anything to help.

Thank you!

Alyssa Tanner

1. Permittee shall not store or place equipment and/or materials inside dripline of any city-owned tree. 

2. All trees in right-of-way should be bored under.  Bore pits and open trenches are not permitted within the dripline of any city-owned tree.  

3. Permittee is responsible for properly pruning trees to prevent damage. If branches greater than 2 inches in diameter require pruning, contact Forestry for consultation and evaluation.

4. No roots of city-owned trees greater than 2 inches in diameter are to be cut. If permittee/contractor encounters city-owned trees with roots greater than 2 inches in diameter that they determine need to be cut, contact Forestry.

5. Mechanical damage to city-owned trees (i.e. bark damage, branch breakage) is not permitted.  Oak trees are not permitted to be pruned from April-November.  Permittee is responsible for properly pruning trees to prevent damage. If extensive pruning is necessary, please contact Forestry.

6. If any city-owned street trees are damaged by this work, the permittee/contractor must contact Forestry as soon as possible so that the damage can be assessed. Permittee will be responsible for all costs associated with damage remediation.

Permit on hold.  Please review comments from engineer who reviewed permit request: 
Call out the right-of-way line on the plans.  There are two notes without leaders - one about the route leaving the public right of way and another about the route continuing outside of Ann Arbor jurisdiction.  Add leaders to show where the notes are applicable.  The sidewalk is not clearly identified on the plans in the cul-de-sac bulb.  City street trees must be shown. Note: There is an easement for private utilities adjacent to the public right-of-way for the purpose of franchise utilities.  This is where these facilities should be 

Once you make your corrections and upload a new set of drawings, please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we can route your permit application for 2nd review.

Good afternoon,

Engineering reviewed your barricade permit application. The application has been denied, because a Lane Closure is needed. Lane Closures are applied for through eTRAKiT. Do you already have a PIN for eTRAKiT?

Thank you,

ROW permit application on hold.    Note from Engineer who reviewed permit: 
Not enough information has been provided to understand the work proposed in the public right-of-way.  A demolition sheet was uploaded that shows removal of asphalt sidewalk, but it뭩 our understanding that a temporary access from Huron Parkway is also desired.  Note that simply driving construction equipment over the curb is not generally acceptable.  All impacts to the right-of-way must be clearly noted, and necessary information for restoration of the right-of-ay must be provided.  

Please make corrections and load a new drawing into eTrakit.  Once you have done that, please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we can have this reviewed again. 

Thanks

Your ROW permit is on hold  please see comments from Engineer who reviewed your application. 

Please clarify the work proposed in the right-of-way.  Are there any dimensional changes in the right-of-way?  Is it simple remove and replace of existing approach with a new concrete approach?  Are there any tree impacts?
Once you confirm the questions above we can get the review process finished. 

Thanks

There are no dimensional changes within the ROW.  No tree impacts.  Presently, the driveway is asphalt and it will be changed to concrete.  Therefore, the remaining 7' in the ROW will be changed to concrete.  We are not replacing the existing 8' concrete approach that leads to the curb or gutter pan.

We are not doing a new drive approach on this job. I didn't realize that I marked that we were. Sorry for the confusion!

(2/1/2021 8:26 AM MB)
sent to Eng to review - cancelled row20-1573 


Good afternoon Michelle,

ROW21-0124

I was unable to modify the application to reflect that it was not a main repair.  But it is also not a main install, so I created the new application and used the subtype SERVICE LEAD.  Cobblestone Farms increased their gas usage and requires that the gas service lead to their property to be improved.  Jason Nealis of Ann Arbor is the project contact and he is cc뭗 in this email.

I have made the requested revisions:

	The permit is no longer submitted as a gas main repair
	The drawing includes a profile of the proposed gas crossing the other utilities (although the records received from Ann Arbor do not include any elevation data where we cross existing facilities  see attached).
	The drawing shows and labels the 12 water main.
	The drawing shows and labels the PLD conduits.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thank you,

David Walsh
Gas Planner

ROW permit application on hold:  note from engineer who reviewed your permit request: 

Add a depth for the gas service lead.  It must be placed at least 36" below grade and 12" above the water main.

Once you load a new drawing with the depth added into eTrakit, please emailcustomerservice@a2gov.org so they can have your permit application reviewed.","22000","475","0","Michcon - David Walsh","-83.71064","42.24563"

Good Morning - We received your ROW permit application.  However, there was no description of the work or a drawing attached into eTrakit.  

Please upload a drawing of the scope of the work and any additional information in regards to ROW disturbance etc. 

Once you have uploaded your drawing into eTrakit, and added description of work, please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we can our Engineering team review ROW permit. 

Thanks 
Michelle Brainard

ROW permit on hold until we have clarification.  Per reviewer: Please ask them to clarify (on the plans) what the purpose of the conduit is (i.e., what뭩 going in it). 

Once you update plans and load a new set into eTrakit, please email customerservice@a2gov.org so we know to have this reviewed again.

Hi- I need something in writing from the contractor that you understand the requirements below, before we can issue the ROW permit. 

Permit approved subject to the following restoration conditions:

2 HMA, LVSP top course
2 HMA, LVSP leveling course
8 21AA dense graded aggregate base
12+ Class II granular material subbase

The patch shall be to the centerline of the street, or if the pavement is disturbed over the centerline, for the full width of the street.  

Send me something back and I can get to Engineering Department so we can issue permit. 

Thanks
