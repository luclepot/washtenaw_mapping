## research questions? 

This is fairly difficult to answer, but I can definitely say a few things

* want to breakdown location-based data into social-investigable tracts of land. 
    * In this case, that probably means specific apartment complexes or city blocks
    * not school districts, voting districts, or wards; these are broader
    * also, project housing is often intermixed within much wealthier housing in AA
    * #TODO: look into what breakdown to use

* how does crime factor into this analysis?
    * can define some basic metrics of crime rates using violent crime/ some other categories
    * can also include rates in which calls come in

* housing stuff
    * population density
    * racial demographics
    * policing stuff
    * owners etc.
    * 

* LOOK AT DEMOGRAPHICS!!!
